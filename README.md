### Hi, I'm Krishna Singh 

I've been enjoying web development 🖥️ for the first time ever since I built my first ReactJs project, "Video streaming platform with integrated AI" . Since then loving this ecosystem and I'm currently on the look out for a role in frontend web development . I'd especially love to work in a team where I can make an impact quickly . If you're hiring, let's chat! . 🚀🚀
